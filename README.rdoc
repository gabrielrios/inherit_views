== Status

inherit_views works with rails 2.x

If you're on <b>rails master (2.3)</b>, you want {inherit_views/master}[http://github.com/ianwhite/inherit_views/tree/master]

If you're on <b>rails 2.2</b>, you want {inherit_views/rails-2.2}[http://github.com/ianwhite/inherit_views/tree/rails-2.2]

If you're on <b>rails 2.0, or 2.1</b>, you want {inherit_views/rails-2.0-2.1}[http://github.com/ianwhite/inherit_views/tree/rails-2.0-2.1]

== what does it do?

This rails plugin allows your controllers to inherit their views from parent controllers.  The default behaviour is to inherit along the ancestor path of the controller, but you can also specify custom inherit view paths to search.

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    inherit_views
  end

  class FooController < ApplicationController
    # will look for views in 'views/foo', then 'views/application'
  end

  class BarController < FooController
    # will look for views in 'views/bar', then 'views/foo', then 'view/application'
  end
  
See InheritViews for more details

NOTE: this plugin is not aimed at having multiple view paths for your controllers, which is addressed with the view_paths addition to ActionController::Base for rails 2.0.  Rather, within these view paths, you can inherit views from other controller paths.

== Development mode

Because of recent changes in the way 2.3 finds templates, using inherit_views may result in a noticeable slow-down in development mode.
<b>This slow down will not occur in production mode.</b> (Thanks to {thedarkone}[http://github.com/thedarkone] for pointing this out,
and showing me the reason why).

If you are noticing a slowdown in development mode check out {rails-dev-boost}[http://github.com/thedarkone/rails-dev-boost].

== Testing & CI

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.

{garlic}[http://github.com/ianwhite/garlic] is used for CI, see garlic.rb for details on
what versions of rails are tested.
