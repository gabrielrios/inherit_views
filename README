garlic - lightweight continuous integration for rails using git

This is not a CI server, use cruisecontrol.rb for that.  This is a simple set
of rake tasks that let you specify a bunch of rails builds to run against, and
dependencies to install.

It works by cloning git repos for all your dependencies (so they all must be
on git), and then using git to checkout various tags and branches to build
your app against.

EXPERIMENTAL - currently under development

# See it in action by downloading git://github.com/ianwhite/inherit_views and
# running rake run_targets in the top-level directory.

# This will clone all the required git repos (done only once), set up the target
# railses (done once), then run the targets.
